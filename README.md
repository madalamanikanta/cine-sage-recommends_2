## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Supabase account for database

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd cine-sage-recommends

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional: External API Keys
VITE_JIKAN_API_URL=https://api.jikan.moe/v4
```

**Getting Supabase Credentials:**
1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings → API
3. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key
4. Run the database migration from `supabase/migrations/`

# Run tests
npm run test

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Run all quality checks

## 🚢 Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
# The dist/ folder contains the built application
```

**Environment Variables for Production:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

## 🔁 Deployment Health Monitor

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/supabase-heartbeat.yml`.
The workflow runs every 3 days and can also be triggered manually via the Actions UI.
It verifies the deployed site, static assets, and Supabase credentials with lightweight checks.

The monitor performs:
- HTTP 200 verification for homepage and critical SPA routes
- Frontend asset loading checks for assets discovered in homepage HTML
- environment configuration validation from deployment secrets
- a lightweight Supabase read query against the `profiles` table
- Supabase credential validation using the official Supabase client

### Required GitHub Secrets
1. `WEBSITE_URL` — production or staging site URL
2. `SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
3. `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anon/public API key
4. `PRODUCTION_URL` — optional alternative to `WEBSITE_URL`

### Running the workflow manually
1. Open the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the `Deployment Health Monitor` workflow.
3. Click `Run workflow`.
4. Optionally provide `website_url` to override the URL for this run.

### Local health check
Run the monitor locally against a deployed URL:

```bash
npm install
npm run health-check -- https://your-app.example.com
```

If any critical check fails, the script exits with a non-zero status.

### Notes
- The health monitor is intentionally lightweight and reads only one `id` from `profiles`.
- It checks both the public Supabase REST API and the frontend deployment.
- It is compatible with static SPA hosts when routing is configured to serve `index.html` for client-side routes.

### Manual Deployment

1. Run `npm run build` to create production bundle
2. Upload `dist/` folder to your hosting provider
3. Configure environment variables in your hosting dashboard
4. Set up redirects for SPA routing (redirect all routes to `/index.html`)

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "run", "preview"]
```
