# Deployment Guide - CineSage on Vercel

This guide walks you through deploying the CineSage anime recommendation app to Vercel with proper configuration and post-deployment validation.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Supabase project is set up and configured
- [ ] Database migrations have been run
- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] Application builds successfully locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Code quality checks pass (`npm run check-all`)

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Vercel configuration exists**
   - Check that `vercel.json` is in your project root
   - Verify build settings are correct

### Step 2: Create Vercel Project

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in**

2. **Click "New Project"**
   ![Vercel New Project Button](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/get-started/deploy#new-project)

3. **Import your Git repository**
   - Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
   - Choose the `cine-sage-recommends` repository
   - Click "Import"

4. **Configure Project Settings**
   ```
   Framework Preset: Vite
   Root Directory: ./
   Build Command: npm run build
   Output Directory: dist
   Install Command: npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Environment Variables Setup

**In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, add:**

| Variable Name | Value | Environment |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://your-project.supabase.co` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `your-anon-key` | Production, Preview, Development |

**Getting Supabase Values:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard

2. **Wait for deployment** - This typically takes 2-3 minutes
3. **Get your deployment URL** - Copy the provided URL (e.g., `https://cine-sage-recommends.vercel.app`)

## ✅ Post-Deployment Validation

### Automated Smoke Tests
